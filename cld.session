This session implemented a "monitor-specific window switching" feature to allow users to switch only between windows on their current monitor.

Key changes:
1. Added utility functions to detect which monitor a window is on:
   - get_current_monitor_from_cursor(): Gets monitor handle based on cursor location
   - is_window_on_monitor(): Determines if a window is displayed on a specific monitor

2. Added configuration options to enable monitor-specific filtering:
   - switch_windows_only_current_monitor and switch_apps_only_current_monitor
   - Added corresponding getter methods with appropriate defaults

3. Modified list_windows() to filter based on monitor:
   - Added parameter to control monitor filtering
   - Updated calls in switch_windows() and switch_apps() methods

4. Updated config files:
   - Added new options to window-switcher.ini with documentation
   - Updated README.md to document the new features

The implementation allows users to conveniently switch between windows only on their current monitor instead of across all monitors.
